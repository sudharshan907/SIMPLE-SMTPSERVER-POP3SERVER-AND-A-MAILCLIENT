SMTP is used to send mails from a mail client to the mail server which does
not help in the mail retrieval process. For that, we use POP3 protocol. POP3
downloads all the messages from the server and stores the messages locally on
your computer or device. However, it is complicated to access email
using POP3 on multiple devices. i.e., if you are using multiple devices, their
mail folder will most likely be different from each other. In order to access
your mailfolder across multiple devices synchronously, you need to use
IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol). 
IMAP is a protocol your email client uses to synchronize all the messages
between the server and your clients. i.e., when you read a message on your
personal laptop, it will also show up as read on your work computer,
smartphone, tablet, and other devices. With IMAP, the email is stored on the
server. (More details of IMAP are available in RFC 1730).


IMAP protocol is better than pop3 protocol overall.however there may be some adv's in pop3 protocol which are not in imap protocol.current gmail uses protocols which is similar to imap=very updated version of imap.(with smooth synchronisation).
